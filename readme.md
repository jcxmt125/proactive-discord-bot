# Discord bot that responds to you proactively
This is a very work-in-progress project.
The goals are to:
- Make a bot that will respond to you when necessary
- Remember who you are
- Possibly some tools when required?

To achieve this, we'll likely have to make the bot read every message it gets and figure out when best to respond...
LLMs will likely be used for all decision making.
The last part might create some OS headaches... let's see where this takes us!

By the way, watch for egress when deploying this on a server... especially free tier.
